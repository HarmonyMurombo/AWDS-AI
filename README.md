# AWDS-AI
Automated Weed Detection System using computer vision and machine learning for precision agriculture.

Welcome to the AWDS AI Github repository!.AWDS AI (Automated Weed Detection System) is an innovative, AI-powered agricultural software solution that harnesses computer vision technology to detect and manage weed infestations in crop fields. By analyzing footage from surveillance cameras, AWDS AI enables farmers to precision-manage their fields like never before.


Structure

This repository is structured as follows:

-Client/:This directory contains the frontend code of the system.It is implimented using Python Qt5 designer framework,Html and Css and python.It also contains the trained model for the AWDS AI that will be used when the monitoring interface is started.  

-Server/:- This directory contains the backend code, including API endpoints and Database models (using Django) and they are implimented using python and django it also contains the requirements.txt file for all the libraries used in the project.

Purpose

WDS AI (Automated Weed Detection System) is a cutting-edge, AI-powered agricultural software solution that leverages computer vision technology to detect and manage weed infestations in crop fields with unparalleled precision. By analyzing footage from surveillance cameras, AWDS AI empowers farmers to optimize crop yields, reduce chemical usage, and streamline field management like never before.

This repository serves as the central hub for AWDS AI's development, maintenance, and collaboration. Here, you'll find the latest code updates, documentation, and resources related to this innovative project.
